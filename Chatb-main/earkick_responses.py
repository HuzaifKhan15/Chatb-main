    # Relationship-related responses
    "relationship_trust": [
        "Trust is fragile and rebuilding it takes time. What small steps might feel safe to you right now?",
        "When trust has been broken, it's natural to feel hesitant about being vulnerable again. Your caution is protecting you.",
        "Trust is built in small moments of reliability over time. It might help to look for those small consistent actions rather than grand gestures.",
        "Learning to trust again often means balancing healthy caution with openness. It's okay to move at your own pace with this."
    ],
    
    "relationship_boundary": [
        "Setting boundaries is about honoring your needs and values. What boundaries do you think might be missing in this situation?",
        "It can be challenging to maintain boundaries, especially with people we care about. What makes it difficult for you to set limits?",
        "Healthy relationships respect each person's boundaries. How might you communicate your needs more clearly?",
        "Boundaries aren't about pushing people away - they're about teaching others how to treat you with respect. What boundary would help you feel safer?"
    ],
    
    "heartbreak": [
        "That kind of pain hits deep. Heartbreak isn't just emotional—it's physical too. Your body remembers connection. Would you like to talk about what you miss most?",
        "Heartbreak creates a special kind of silence in your life. The absence of someone who once filled your days. I'm here to listen if you want to share more about what you're feeling.",
        "When someone leaves, they take pieces of your shared world with them. It's okay to grieve those lost futures and possibilities. What feels hardest right now?",
        "That ache of missing someone can feel bottomless sometimes. You don't have to navigate it alone. What's been most difficult for you in this process?"
    ],
    
    "breakup_ghosting": [
        "Being left without closure or explanation can feel like a special kind of betrayal. That silence often hurts more than words would. What would you say to them if you had the chance?",
        "Ghosting leaves you holding all the pieces, trying to make sense of what happened. That uncertainty can be harder than a clear ending. How have you been trying to find closure?",
        "When someone disappears without explanation, it's natural to fill that silence with self-doubt. But their leaving says more about them than about you. What thoughts have been heaviest for you?",
        "That kind of disappearance leaves you questioning everything—including your own perceptions. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, even without their confirmation. What has been hardest to process?"
    ],
    
    "betrayal": [
        "Betrayal cuts deep because it breaks trust at its foundation. What you're feeling—the hurt, anger, confusion—it's all valid. Would you like to talk about what happened?",
        "When trust is broken, it can shake your sense of reality and make you question your judgment. That's a normal response to betrayal, not a flaw in you. How has this affected your ability to trust?",
        "The pain of betrayal often comes in waves—sometimes it's anger, sometimes deep sadness, sometimes questioning yourself. All those feelings deserve space. Where do you find yourself most often?",
        "Healing from betrayal takes time because you're not just grieving the relationship, but also the version of it you believed in. That's a complex loss. What feelings come up strongest for you right now?"
    ],
    
    "breakup_still_love": [
        "Loving someone even after the relationship ends is such a human experience. Love doesn't always follow the same timeline as relationships. What aspects of them do you find hardest to let go of?",
        "It's possible to both love someone and recognize that the relationship wasn't right. That contradiction can be painful to hold. How are you navigating those complicated feelings?",
        "Love fades slower than pain sometimes. That doesn't mean you made a mistake in loving them—it means your capacity for connection is deep. How are you caring for yourself while these feelings are still present?",
        "The heart doesn't always follow logic. You can know something is over while still feeling deeply attached. Both realities can exist at once. What helps you when those feelings of love feel overwhelming?"
    ],
    
    "breakup_comparison": [
        "Seeing them move on or appear happy can trigger so much pain and questioning. Remember that social media and appearances rarely tell the full story. What specific feelings come up when you see them now?",
        "Comparing your healing journey to theirs is a natural impulse, but healing isn't linear or competitive. Your process is your own. What would help you focus on your path rather than theirs?",
        "It can feel like a special kind of pain when they seem to have moved on faster. But appearing 'fine' doesn't always mean they've processed everything. What would genuine healing look like for you?",
        "That contrast between their apparent happiness and your pain can feel cruel. But your healing isn't dependent on their timeline. What small steps could help you reclaim your joy?"
    ],

    # Emotional state responses with deeper understanding
    "loneliness_deep": [
        "Loneliness isn't just about being alone—it's about missing a certain quality of connection. You can be surrounded by people and still feel that hollow space inside. What kind of connection do you find yourself missing most?",
        "There's something particularly painful about feeling unseen or unknown by the people around you. That invisibility can make the world feel very cold. Have there been moments when you've felt truly seen by someone?",
        "We're wired for connection as humans, which is why loneliness can feel like an actual physical ache. It's your brain telling you a core need isn't being met. What small step might help you begin to bridge that gap?",
        "Sometimes loneliness comes from feeling like you have to hide parts of yourself to be accepted. That creates distance even in relationships that look close from the outside. Do you feel you can be your authentic self with anyone in your life?"
    ],
    
    "depression_deep": [
        "Depression often feels like moving through life underwater—everything takes more effort and feels muted. That heaviness isn't laziness or weakness; it's your mind and body under real strain. What aspects of daily life feel most difficult right now?",
        "When depression is present, your brain actually processes information differently. Negative thoughts become magnified while positive experiences can barely register. How has this filter affected the way you see yourself?",
        "The exhaustion that comes with depression is real physical fatigue, not just feeling tired. Your brain is working overtime on difficult emotions. What small things have you managed to do despite that heaviness?",
        "Depression can make the future feel completely foreclosed—like nothing will ever change or improve. But that's the depression speaking, not reality. Can you think of a time when something felt unchangeable but eventually shifted?"
    ],
    
    "anxiety_deep": [
        "When anxiety takes over, your body can go into full alert mode even when there's no actual danger. It's exhausting to live with your threat system constantly activated. What helps you feel safer in those moments?",
        "With anxiety, our minds often play worst-case scenarios on repeat. It's like having an overactive alarm system that can't differentiate between real and imagined threats. Which thoughts seem to trigger your anxiety the most?",
        "Anxiety lives in the future—it pulls you out of the present and into all the 'what ifs.' Grounding techniques can help bring you back to what's actually happening right now. Would you like to try one together?",
        "Your body doesn't know the difference between an anxious thought and a real threat—it responds the same way to both. That's why anxiety feels so physical. Where do you feel it most in your body?"
    ],
    
    # Trauma and difficult experiences
    "childhood_trauma": [
        "Childhood experiences shape us profoundly because they happen when our brains and sense of self are still developing. Those early patterns can feel deeply ingrained. Which patterns do you find yourself wrestling with most?",
        "When difficulties happen in childhood, we often internalize them—believing there's something wrong with us rather than with what happened to us. How has that affected your relationship with yourself?",
        "Children often can't process difficult experiences in the moment, so those feelings get stored for later. Now as an adult, you have more resources to work through what once felt overwhelming. What support do you need with that process?",
        "The child you were deserved safety, care, and unconditional love. When those needs weren't adequately met, it creates real wounds. How do you connect with and care for that younger part of yourself now?"
    ],
    
    "trauma_response": [
        "Trauma responses aren't character flaws—they're adaptations your brain made to keep you safe. Those reactions made sense in the context where they developed. How do they show up for you now?",
        "When something triggers a trauma response, you're essentially experiencing the past in the present moment. Your brain can't tell the difference. What sensations or feelings let you know you've been triggered?",
        "Our bodies keep score of past experiences, especially difficult ones. Sometimes they remember what our conscious minds have tried to forget. Are there specific situations that seem to activate these responses for you?",
        "Healing from trauma often means slowly teaching your nervous system that the danger has passed. It takes patience and compassion with yourself. What helps you feel safer when these responses arise?"
    ],
    
    "grief_loss": [
        "Grief has its own timeline. There's no right or wrong way to move through it—only your way. What does your grief feel like today?",
        "Loss creates empty spaces in our lives that nothing else quite fills. Those spaces are actually proof of how real your love was. What do you miss most?",
        "Sometimes grief feels like carrying an invisible weight that others can't see but you feel constantly. It changes over time but doesn't follow a neat path. How has your grief evolved?",
        "When we lose someone or something meaningful, we also lose all the future moments we imagined having. That's a significant part of grief too. What futures are you grieving?"
    ],
    
    # Validation and emotional support
    "validation_deep": [
        "What you're feeling makes complete sense given what you've been through. Anyone would struggle with this situation.",
        "I hear how difficult this has been for you. Your reaction is completely understandable.",
        "It sounds like you've been carrying this burden for a long time. That takes incredible strength, even on the days when you don't feel strong.",
        "Your feelings are valid responses to a really challenging situation. You're not overreacting or being too sensitive.",
        "I believe you. What happened to you matters, and how you feel about it matters too."
    ],
    
    "self_compassion": [
        "We often treat ourselves with a harshness we would never direct at someone we care about. What would it look like to speak to yourself with the same kindness you offer others?",
        "Self-compassion isn't self-indulgence—it's recognizing that you're human and deserving of care, especially when you're struggling. What small act of kindness could you offer yourself today?",
        "When we've learned to be hard on ourselves, self-compassion can actually feel uncomfortable or undeserved. Have you noticed resistance to being gentle with yourself?",
        "Treating yourself with compassion actually builds resilience. It gives you a secure internal base to return to when things get difficult. What helps you access that kinder inner voice?"
    ],
    
    # Self-discovery and identity
    "perfectionism": [
        "Perfectionism often masquerades as high standards, but it can be a protection against vulnerability or criticism. What do you fear might happen if you weren't perfect?",
        "The impossible standards we set for ourselves are ones we'd never apply to someone we love. How might you speak to yourself if you were talking to a good friend instead?",
        "Behind perfectionism is often the painful belief that your worth depends on your performance. But your value isn't earned through achievement. What would it feel like to separate your worth from your work?",
        "Perfectionism can keep us from starting things or from finishing them—nothing ever feels good enough. How has this pattern affected what you allow yourself to try?"
    ],
    
    "people_pleasing": [
        "Always prioritizing others' needs can leave you feeling invisible in your own life. Whose needs tend to overshadow yours most often?",
        "People-pleasing often starts as a survival strategy. It helps us stay safe in relationships by anticipating and meeting others' expectations. How did this pattern develop for you?",
        "Learning to honor your own needs isn't selfish—it's necessary for authentic connection. True relationships have room for both people's experiences. What need of yours feels most important to voice right now?",
        "Sometimes we fear that if we stop pleasing others, we'll lose them. That fear can keep us trapped in exhausting patterns. What small step toward authenticity feels possible for you?"
    ],
    
    "identity_struggle": [
        "Questioning who you are isn't a failure—it's often the beginning of becoming more authentically yourself. What parts of your identity feel most solid to you?",
        "Sometimes we outgrow old versions of ourselves before we've fully formed new ones. That in-between space can feel disorienting but it's also full of possibility. What versions of yourself are you exploring?",
        "Our sense of self is shaped by so many things—relationships, culture, experiences. It's natural for it to evolve over time. Which changes in yourself have been most challenging to integrate?",
        "Finding your authentic self often means sorting through who you've been told to be versus who you actually are. What parts of your life feel most aligned with your true self?"
    ],
    
    "meaning_purpose": [
        "Questioning your purpose isn't a sign something's wrong—it often happens when you're growing or when old answers no longer fit. What used to give your life meaning?",
        "Sometimes meaning isn't found in grand purpose but in small moments of connection, beauty, or contribution. Have there been moments recently when time seemed to stop because you were fully present?",
        "Many people find that meaning shifts throughout life rather than being one fixed thing. Different chapters can have different purposes. What values feel most important to you right now?",
        "That search for meaning is deeply human. We all need to feel our lives matter in some way. When have you felt most alive or that what you were doing truly mattered?"
    ],
    
    # Generation Z specific responses
    "validation_gen_z": [
        "That's completely valid. Anyone would feel the same way.",

    ],
    
    "anxiety_gen_z": [
        "That anxious feeling is the worst. Your body's alarm system is basically glitching and going off when there's no real danger.",
        "When your thoughts start spiraling, it's like your brain's stuck in a toxic group chat it can't leave.",
        "Anxiety is like having too many tabs open in your brain all the time. It's exhausting.",

        "Your worth isn't determined by your productivity or achievements. You matter simply because you exist.",
        "Healing isn't linear. Having difficult days doesn't mean you've lost progress—it's part of the journey.",
        "You don't have to earn rest or basic care. Your body and mind deserve attention simply because they're yours.",
        "The parts of yourself that you struggle to accept are often the places where your greatest wisdom and compassion grow from.",

        "Growth often happens in the spaces between trying—in rest, reflection, and even in seeming setbacks.",
